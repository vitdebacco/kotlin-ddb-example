          "Description": {"S": "The best Jimma washed coffees have a syrupy heavier body than other washed Ethiopian coffees. Yukro, a small cooperative established in 2010, has stood out for its quality. The co-op members harvest from the forest around them and from plantings. They carefully soak the ripe beans in very clean spring water, after demucilaging, to extract the maximum clarity and sweetness of flavor.\n\nTechnoServe, an NGO, is working directly with the Yukro Cooperative and other cooperatives in the region as a coordinator between agronomists and managers, as well as a business adviser to help the cooperatives manage their debts, re-invest in quality improvements at the mills, and verify distribution of income to all members. The achievements of the Ethiopian farmer communities with the assistance of TechnoServe seem monumental to me. From producers of run-of-mill commercial coffee of little worth they have catapulted to being the highest quality producers in Ethiopia, in my opinion."},

The lot we are offering is 100% “Gesha 1931” variety – closely resembling the famed Panamanian Gesha in plant morphology, bean shape and size, as well as cup profile.\n\nThe natural processed micro-lot we chose took us by storm for its complexity and clarity. Here is a natural processed Gesha that allows all the delicate varietal and terroir notes to sing, unimpeded. Such subtlety and nuance in a natural is very rare, in our experience. We believe this delicate balance is due to an unusually prolonged intensely dry harvest season, allowing the enveloping fruit to dry with a minimum of microbiotic ferment. The natural processing coats the coffee with a gentle translucent glaze of fruit-tinged butterscotch."},

This Gesha was harvested on a single day at peak ripeness and processed meticulously right through drying. The result is a champagne-like Gesha! It positively sparkles.\n\nHuehuetenango is a spectacular region of steep, sharp-toothed mountains and narrow valleys. Warm winds from the hot Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico, to the north, flow through narrow north-south valleys, warming the mountainsides and allowing coffee growth at far higher altitudes than would ordinarily be possible for such northern latitudes.\n\nEl Injerto has justly become legendary for the quality of its coffees, winning far more Presidential Cup of Excellence Awards than any other farm in any country. With each year the Aguirres improve their farm in quality production, social development and environmental preservation."},
