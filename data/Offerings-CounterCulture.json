Inspired by his neighbors’ successes, Abel planted coffee on a small plot of land four years ago. Last year, the very first harvest from Abel Salinas’ farm took top honors at a local cupping competition. We were lucky to buy a small amount of that coffee last year and we didn’t hesitate to contract more this season. This year’s lot boasts honey-like sweetness, nectarine fruit complexity, and a soft floral finish."},

The combination of relatively young coffee trees, excellent varieties, high elevation, and very ripe coffee cherry picking practices result in this distinct coffee. We taste notes of lime, vibrant florals, and dark honey."},
